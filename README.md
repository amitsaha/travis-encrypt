# travis-encrypt

Encrypt strings for use in your travis-ci .travis.yml configuration files.

Contained here are 2 versions:

* [Python](python/)
* [Go](go/)

The ideas for this script come from [travis](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis) and [node-travis-encrypt](https://github.com/pwmckenna/node-travis-encrypt).

I didn't want to use either of the above as I don't use ruby and node, so I wrote a python version.  I also realize that some people don't use python either, so to bridge the gap I also wrote a version in Go.
